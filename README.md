# HearingHeroes

Interactive speech discrimination game for children with hearing impairments, particularly those with cochlear implants.

## Project Overview

HearingHeroes is designed to help children practice consonant manner contrasts through engaging audio-visual exercises. The game focuses on speech discrimination with a progressive difficulty system and detailed progress tracking for parents and speech language pathologists (SLPs).

### Key Features

- ðŸŽ® Interactive audio-visual exercises with image pairs
- ðŸ“Š Comprehensive progress tracking and visualization
- ðŸ“± Designed specifically for iPad use
- ðŸ”’ Protected parent/SLP dashboard with metrics
- ðŸ“¶ Full offline functionality as a PWA

## Technology Stack

- TypeScript
- React
- PixiJS for animations
- Vite for building
- IndexedDB for local data storage
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Jest and React Testing Library for testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm (v8 or later)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd hearing-heroes

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Available Scripts

## Game Structure

### Level Progression

1. **Level 1**: Basic high-contrast consonants (p/b, t/d)
2. **Level 2**: More challenging contrasts (f/v, s/z)
3. **Level 3**: Multi-syllable words or phrases
4. **Level 4**: Words in simple sentences

### Metrics Tracked

- Accuracy percentage
- Response time
- Progress across specific contrast types
- Retry counts and success rates
- Session duration and frequency

## Development

### Branch Strategy

- `setup` - Project initialization
- `game-mechanics` - Core gameplay functionality
- `content-progression` - Game content and progression system
- `parent-dashboard` - Parent/SLP metrics dashboard
- `refinement` - Testing and optimization
