# Compact 1

> This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
  <analysis>
  Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to ensure I capture all key elements, technical details, and decisions.

  1. Initial Request and Project Conceptualization:
     - The user wanted to create a game for their toddler daughter, Samantha, who has a cochlear implant
     - The game is focused on speech discrimination practice with consonant manner contrasts
     - The user wants metrics tracking to see progression over time
     - The application should include a parent section for sharing progress with an SLP

  2. Technical Specification Discussion:
     - Decided on TypeScript, React + PixiJS, IndexedDB, Vite
     - App should run offline and be designed for an iPad as a PWA
     - Authentication via simple multiplication questions
     - The app was named "HearingHeroes"

  3. Project Setup Phase:
     - Created technical specification and project structure documents
     - Set up Git with branching strategy for development phases
     - Created YAML structure for word pairs instead of embedding in TypeScript
     - Installed dependencies and configured development environment
     - Added testing strategy with Jest and React Testing Library

  4. Basic Application Structure:
     - Created React components with router structure
     - Added Tailwind CSS for styling
     - Created context for app state management
     - Set up PWA features with service worker and manifest

  5. Core Services Implementation:
     - Created YAML loader utility
     - Implemented word pairs service
     - Created database service for IndexedDB operations
     - Implemented metrics tracking service for progress analytics
     - Added audio service for sound and speech playback

  6. Current State:
     - We've completed the initial "setup" branch work
     - Attempted to merge the setup branch to main branch but encountered merge conflicts
     - All basic services are implemented and working

  The most recent work was trying to merge the setup branch to main and tag the release as v0.1.0, but there was a merge conflict with the prompts.md file.
  This file appears to be a log of the conversation and is not directly related to the application code.

  1. Primary Request and Intent:
     The user is creating a speech discrimination game called "HearingHeroes" for their daughter Samantha, who has a cochlear implant. The game aims to help
   with discrimination speech training by building on flash card exercises she's doing with her SLP (Speech-Language Pathologist). Key requirements include:
     - An iPad-based game that doesn't require App Store publishing, using PixiJS for rendering
     - Focus on consonant manner contrasts (like cave/wave) with progressive difficulty levels
     - Performance metrics tracking to monitor progress over time
     - A parent section with authentication to view metrics and share with the SLP
     - Offline functionality as a PWA
     - A development process with git branches for each major feature for an article the user plans to publish about the development process

  2. Key Technical Concepts:
     - TypeScript with React for development
     - PixiJS for game rendering
     - IndexedDB for data storage and metrics
     - YAML for storing word pair data (separate from code)
     - Tailwind CSS for styling
     - Vite for building
     - PWA capabilities for offline access
     - Service worker for caching resources
     - Git branching strategy for feature development phases
     - Jest and React Testing Library for testing

  3. Files and Code Sections:
     - `/technical_specification.md`: Contains detailed specifications for the game including technology stack, game design, metrics tracking, and
  development phases
     - `/CLAUDE.md`: Project guide with technical overview, commands, branching strategy and testing approach
     - `/package.json`: Project dependencies including React, PixiJS, Tailwind, etc.
     - `/src/context/AppContext.tsx`: React context for app state management including auth state, level progress, audio preferences
     - `/src/routes.tsx`: React Router configuration with lazy-loaded components
     - `/src/components/game/GameContainer.tsx`: PixiJS integration for the game canvas
     - `/src/services/wordPairsService.ts`: Service for loading and filtering word pairs from YAML
     - `/src/services/dbService.ts`: IndexedDB service for storing and querying practice data
     - `/src/services/metricsService.ts`: Service for tracking and analyzing performance metrics
     - `/src/services/audioService.ts`: Service for audio playback including word prompts and feedback sounds
     - `/public/sw.js`: Service worker for offline functionality and resource caching
     - `/public/data/wordPairs.yml`: YAML data for consonant contrast word pairs

  4. Problem Solving:
     - Created a modular architecture separating data (YAML) from application logic
     - Implemented responsive design for iPad usage in both orientations
     - Set up PWA configuration for offline access with service worker
     - Created a dynamic parent authentication system with randomized multiplication problems
     - Implemented database structure for storing and analyzing metrics
     - Organized code with clear separation of concerns (services, components, types)

  5. Pending Tasks:
     - Create placeholder icons for PWA (low priority)
     - Resolve merge conflict with prompts.md file
     - Complete the merge of the setup branch to main branch

  6. Current Work:
     We were working on merging the setup branch to the main branch and tagging the first phase completion. We attempted to use git stash to handle the
  merge conflict with prompts.md, but the conflict still occurred. We need to resolve this merge conflict to complete Phase 1 of the project. All the core
  setup code is complete, but the git merge needs to be finalized.

  7. Optional Next Step:
     Resolve the merge conflict with prompts.md either by:
     1. Manually resolving the conflict by editing the file
     2. Using `git checkout --ours prompts.md` or `git checkout --theirs prompts.md` to choose one version
     3. Ignoring prompts.md entirely since it's just a conversation log file that's not needed for the application

     After resolving the conflict, complete the merge with `git add prompts.md && git commit` and then tag the release with `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Phase 1:
  Project Setup complete"`.

  Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked
  to work on.
